# hazard-processor-w-o-hazard-detection-forward
This repository is a pratical exercise to understanding the hazards related to a single cycle processor. 
In order to do that, the C code named as pseudo-code-algorithm was converted to assembly with no corrections related to the processor arquiteture. The goal of this exercise is to study the code and make the necessary corrections, based in the processor arquitetura, with the objective to it work as desire.  Each folder correspond to a processor with different capabilitys of hazard detection and forwarding.
