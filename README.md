# Hazards of a single cycle pipelined processor
This repository's goal is to study the hazards of a single cycle pipelined processor. To do that the same assembly code, derived from the C code named as pseudo-code-algorithm , will be adjusted to work properly in different processors. This repository explores with more attention the following topics
- Data forwarding
- Hazard detection
- Code efficiency
  - Renaming
  - Reordering
  - Loop unroll 
  
In the root of the repository, each folder corresponds to a processor with different capabilities.
**The instruction set used to do that task was RISC-V.**
