# Hazards of a single cycle pipelined processor
This repository goal is to study hazards of a single cycle pipelined processor. In order to do that the same assembly code, derived from the C code named as pseudo-code-algorithm , will be adjusted to work properly in different processors. This repository explore with more attention the implication of following topics in our assembly code:
- Data forwarding
- Hazard detection
- Possible processor stages to do the branch comparatiom

In the root of the repository each folder correspond to a processor with different capabilitys.
**The intruction set used to do that task was RISC-V.**
