**Step by step loop unrolling analysis 
First the code of the loop part was duplicate in order to unroll it. Then the offsets of the loads of the second part of the loop code have been changed to correct the difference of the i value, once i will just be increased in the end of the loop by 8 (2 words). During the loop the operation b[i] < 0, implemented via a branch comparison need to be perform twice, to ensure that none b negative value will be "jumped". All the adjust of index were performed in the end of the loop only once by the double of the previous unrolled loop. The srai operation that changes the value of n in bytes to words was removed from the loop to decrease the number of cycles. Now that the loop is unrolled and functional some reordering were applied in order to use the loads delay slot and prevent unnecessary stalls.
